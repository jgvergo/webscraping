while our work is important to us we are riders too and any day we can spend listening to the revs of an enginebe it from an inline fourcylinder or a rumbling vtwinor actually throwing on a helmet ourselves and going for a cruise sign us up
following the recent launch of our first generation of nuviz headup display devices we wanted to be where the action is and where our customers are
so to kickoff the first of many events we will attend in the near future we decided to make the drive from our offices in san diego up to auto club speedway in fontana california for what is arguably one of the most intense yet relaxed days you can spend on two wheels
fastrack riders is the premier track experience in southern california one which we are proud to sponsor alongside several other great companies within our industry
everyone from your average sportbike owner who is looking to put their machine and skills to the test legally and safely to racing legends like the bostrom brotherseric and bencome out for a oneofakind weekend on the tarmac
auto club speedway is a twomile 3 km lowbanked dshaped oval superspeedway that has hosted nascar racing annually since 1997 but the facility also utilizes the infield of the massive oval to accommodate several other types of motorsports including a roadcourse layout for motorcycles and autos
fastrack riders offers motorcycle training schools and track days available to the public on this road course and while several racers and trackgoers opt out of riding on public roads racing is something we are passionate about and going fast on two wheels is damned cool no matter how you slice it
you cannot truly experience a nuviz device without it properly set up on a helmet let alone test one out so to help riders demo a nuviz in style and comfort 6d helmets delivered a full size run of their topoftheline ats1 helmet to ensure the right fit for anyone actually taking to the streets
the ats1 features 6ds patented omnidirectional suspension ods technology an inhelmet suspension and kinetic energy management system that allows the helmet to sheer and displace threedimensionally when subjected to impact
in other words it is good for your noggin in case of a crash
we also enjoy the helmets integrated speaker pockets that provide a perfect fit for the nuviz headsets
our goal for the next year
get out and meet as many motorcycle enthusiasts as we can
from track days to bike nights to rallies to races we want to hit as many amazing events as possible to offer technical support for existing nuvizers and to provide demos for those who have yet to get their hands on a deviceas well as to have a little fun in the process

b8ta founded by software engineer vibhu norby alongside william mintun and phillip raub developed their oneofakind business model aiming to provide better options to companies launching new products while wanting to maintain control over their brands
the transactional nature of a company selling a product to a retailer and a retailer marking it upwithout the manufacturer having any visibility or control of the marketing of their products at retaildoes not make sense in todays world says raub b8tas cmo  b8tas brickandmortar locations provide the perfect opportunity for consumers to get their hands on new tech gadgets and actually try them out before buying
and the kicker
b8ta does not make money on the products it sells
the brands they feature keep 100 percent of the money on every sale and b8ta simply charges for instore space and services
products are shipped to b8ta and manufacturer representatives train the b8ta teama highly knowledgeable staff that can describe the attributes of the product
for brands it is a learning curve and an opportunity to understand if their products are priced properly and if the content on their displays is resonating with customers raub explains
we feel invested in making them successful by coming in and learning what is working and what is not raub explains
as of today nuviz is available in b8tas santa monica and austin locations and the san francisco and houston stores will be included in the coming week

to deliver exciting new products that provide a better riding experience for our customers
that however does not mean we will not continuously strive to improve the products that our customers have already purchased
no matter how good a product is it can always be better which is why we are excited to release nuv15 for download through the nuviz app
nuv15 will dramatically enhance functionality for riders primarily with respect to audio quality device integration route planning and overall user experience so you do not want to pass this up
simply power up your device open your nuviz app on your phone go into settings nuviz software update and then follow the instructionsbut make sure your device is connected to the app and that your device has a strong wlan connection
key features of the nuv15 software release include  sirigoogle now support   initiate sirigoogle now voice assistant using the nuviz controller voice key long press allowing for a truly handsoff experience
offline route planning   riders can now download offline maps to their phones allowing for accurate route planning when no data connection is available using this new featur
additionally routes planned via the nuviz app are now stored in the users account enabling access and usage from several devices
for example a user can plan a route via their ipad at home and it will sync with their iphone for use on their ride
passenger intercom   allows for automatic voice communication between a nuviz rider using wired headset and a passenger using any bluetoothenabled headset when both wired and bt headsets are connected
using the nuviz controller voice key the rider can enabledisable the intercom

this convenient new capability essentially doubles as another nuviz controller
improved display brightness control   offers manual control of the nuviz systems display brightness allowing riders to override nuvizs builtin ambient light sensor which actively meters light conditions and automatically adjusts for optimum display visibility
riding down the road on a motorcycle at highway speeds with a passenger behind you and helmets on is obviously not the ideal environment for safely talking to your passenger hearing listening to music talking on the phone or searching for content or directions said marcel rogalla founder and ceo of nuviz
this new release was primarily geared towards significantly improving and simplifying all those activities while enhancing rider safety and our test riders have verified the result

but if it we are physicallyand financiallypossible we would go everywhere
from dirt to asphalt from mountains to desert the call of revving bike engines beckons usbut the beach
yes we are based in san diego where bikes and beaches go together like stripper poles and stilettos but more often than not all the cool events are held where there is plenty of room to run and play and urban beach areas in southern california are typically without
roland sands design thought otherwise however and after dreaming about a beachfront moto event for years the rsd crew kicked off the inaugural moto beach classic this past october at bolsa chica state beach an underdeveloped beach area just north of huntington city beach in orange county california
partnering with sea legs live an outdoor concert venue on the sand at bolsa chica rsds oneday festival brought bikes babes bands and booze together at the beachall the bs any moto lover can only wish for in one placealong with many of the best brands within the motorcycle community
amazing vendors super hooligan flat track racing drag and minibike racing motorcycle stunt shows surf comps local artists food and custom motorcycles packed bolsa chica to capacity with the help of twowheel enthusiasts from all over and to top it off reggae tunes filled the air during the day with live performances by black uhuru and wargirl while punk rock closed out the night with lit and unwritten law taking the stage
is the moto beach classic an event we will look forward to in the future
hell yes
we are already counting down the days until next years and we hope to see as many of you there as possibl

what most do not realize however is how small our motorcycle industry actually is and no matter what city or country we are in or what event we are working at we always see some of the same friendly faces
the shift boutique area at this years progressive international motorcycle shows is the latest creation from the folks at ims and aside from a rad little lounge area in the middle of the show floor that features multiple boutiquestyle brands for visitors to check out shift actually helps bring the brands it hosts even closer together
the shared space allows us to mingle more check out each others products without wandering too far from our space and even laugh at whoever stumbles in a little late to the show with a hangover from the previous nights postshow festivities
we have had a blast so far at ims this year in long beach and new york and we are looking forward to the upcoming shows in dallas and chicago that we will attend in february
we hope to see you ther

jan 25 2018  posted by chris kimball    if you are reading this chances are you are in fact familiar with nuviz and you already know what a hud isto a certain extent
but what do you really know about headup displays
most information regarding hud technology can get a little too technical for your average consumer myself included but below you will find some basic info on what huds are where they came from and who uses them
but seriously though what in the actual hell is a hud
hud stands for headup display or headsup display but we use headup because most of us only have one head each which is any transparent display that presents data without requiring users to look away from their usual viewpoints
when we are huds developed
huds we are originally developed for military use specifically military aviation back in the 1940s and 1950s and actually evolved from a preworld war ii parallaxfree optical sight technology called the reflector sight
the reflector sight was invented in 1900 and is still the base component in many modern huds
where does the name come from
well this certainly is not rocket science
the origin of the name stems from a pilot being able to view information with the head positioned up and looking forward instead of angled down looking at lower instruments
another advantage that came from the use of huds was that the pilots eyes did not need to refocus to view outside of the cockpit after looking at the opticallynearer instruments
both of these factors are crucial to motorcyclists as well
some bikes have information displayed as far down as on the gas tank and we all know how dangerous it is to take your eyes off the road for even a split second
who uses huds today
today huds are used in commercial aircraft automobiles and other mostly professional applications but with the emergence of devices like the nuviz huds are becoming more available at the consumer level
what types of huds are there
other than fixed mounted huds where the displays are mounted to the cockpit of a plane or the dash of a vehicle there are also headmounted displays and helmetmounted displays both abbreviated hmd that feature a display element that moves with the orientation of the users head
many modern fighter jets such as the fa18 f16 and eurofighter use both a hud and hmd concurrent
the f35 lightning ii was designed without a hud relying solely on the hmd making it the first modern military fighter not to have a fixed hud
the price of one of these helmetmounted display systems
a cool 400000 usd
what does a typical hud consist of
a typical hud contains three primary components a projector unit a combiner and a videogeneration computer
the projection unit in a typical hud is an optical collimator setup a convex lens or concave mirror with a cathode ray tube lightemitting diode display or liquid crystal display lcd at its focus which produces an image where the light is collimated and the focal point is perceived to be at infinity
the combiner is typically an angled flat piece of glass a beam splitter located directly in front of the viewer that redirects the projected image from the projector so the user can see the field of view and the projected infinity image at the same tim
combiners may have special coatings that reflect the monochromatic light projected onto it from the projector unit while allowing all other wavelengths of light to pass through
in some optical layouts combiners may also have a curved surface to refocus the image from the projector
the computer provides the interface between the projection unit and the data to be displayed and generates the imagery and symbology to be displayed by the projection unit
what is an ar hud
the futur
modern headup displays are being replaced with a newer technology called augmented reality ar
these ar systems are the new version of huds but are far more advanced
ar huds can integrate with gps systems infrared cameras the internet and mobile apps and transform your car windshield helmet windscreen or even eyeglasses into an information screen
and yes nuviz is indeed an ar hud

busted out windows rooms connected by doorways carved by sledgehammers and concrete floors layered with dust provide an ambiance like no other but lining the brick walls of the old and decaying building are hundreds of custom classic concept and rare motorcycles that made the midwinter journey to stand trial before the show is judges
and while the bikes are the main attraction at the one moto show the fun goes far beyond glistening chrome and sparkling paint
vendors selling everything from helmets to hot dogs oneofakind motorcyclethemed art minibike races cold brews and some of portlands finest coffee keep your eyes and taste buds more than occupied and off location the weekend will keep you on your toes with after parties stunt shows and intense flat track racing at a local indoor speedway
nine years ago see see motor coffee co set out to celebrate the weird rare and unconventional bikes that they love in a way for everyone to enjoy and in doing so they have created something that should be on every motorcycle enthusiasts bucket list
the one moto show is hopefully here to stay for years to come and we cannot wait to return next year to see what they have in store for its 10year anniversary
hopefully we will see you there too

and although it is held in the dead of winter the cold did not stop what was almost 60000 finnish motorcycle enthusiasts from flocking to the messukeskus expo and convention centre helsinki to check out the latest and greatest in gear and machines from the largest brands around the world
is it easy to get excited about a motorcycle show when you still have months away from throwing a leg over your favorite machine
according to the finns being cooped up inside is the perfect time to start preparing for the upcoming seasons journeys whether it is simply buying a few new parts or completely tearing down your bike and building something crazy
not to mention the mp show has europes largest indoor test track which allows people attending the event to try out some new bikes as well as get their riding fix without crashing into a snowbank
nuviz did not launch until after last years show so this year was all hands on deck for the finland nuviz crew and we had a blast hanging out with everyone who stopped by our booth including nuviz team rider and fim world supersport championship contender niki tuuli and the dudesons jarppi leppala
until next year finland

while there are numerous highquality helmet manufacturers on the market that all have complete ranges of fullface options designed primarily to meet todays high standards of comfort and protection style is also a crucial factor when riders choose the helmet that is right for them
helmet brands want to stand out from the rest with their design and for that reason the contours of helmet chin bars vary drastically
so what does that mean
some helmets are unfortunately more difficult than others to mount a nuviz
for a secure fit we recommend to our customers that at least 23 of the helmet mount is adhered firmly to the surface of their chin bar but if that is not possible due to the shape we have another trick up our sleevea magical substance called sugru
what the hell is sugru you ask
sugru mouldable glue is a soft and malleable material similar to playdough but after you roll it in your fingers press it where you need it and mold it by hand into any shape it hardens into a waterproof and longlasting product similar to other silicone rubbers
you can use it to fix just about anything but we use it almost as an extension to our mounting plate that allows us to fix our nuviz firmly to any chin bar on the market
once you open the package sugru reacts at room temperature simply by the exposure to air and you have about 30 minutes to shape it smooth it and reposition it as required
let sit for 24 hours and voila tricky chinbar problem solved
we typically use an entire black 3pack for one helmet mount which costs roughly 12 us
eventually we would love to have custom mounting plates for every helmet on the market which we have actually started working on with schuberth but until then this is the best option out there
if you have any questions about using the product feel free to contact us at supportridenuvizcom 
the link for the black 3pack is below
happy riding

all proceeds go to the pediatric brain tumor foundation 
last year was a revelation said bryan carroll producer of why we ride films organizers of the ev
the number of people who participated and the diversity was really inspirational
riders came from multiple states and countries as far away as mexico and india  people of all stripes with a common love of motorcycle riding came together and took part and that same wide array of participants are signing up this year as well
onethird of entrants for this years ride are new building on wordofmouth raving by past and returning riders and growing a community of likeminded people that feels like a large extended family
of course everyone loves a good because but the diversity of sponsors and participants really illustrates how the hollywood motorcycling and other communities have united to benefit those in need namely children with serious medical issues
the ride has consistently doubled its raise every year and this type of growth in funds raised is expected again this year
participants in the charity ride enjoy a bevy of perks in addition to the awesome ride including cocktails and vittles at the wwr riders dinner gift bags special guest speakers and vip access to the quail motorcycle gathering including a private ride to the event exclusive parking and private lounge access
participants really engaged last year said bryan carroll
we had a lot of people with a lot of different backgrounds and everyone really came together had fun and bonded
we are looking to build on that this year then really ramp things up for next years big fifthannual ride  of course none of this would be possible without great sponsorship
last years list of sponsors topped 25 and this years array for the fourth invitational why we ride to the quail is shaping up including refuse specialists  indian  motorcycles  motodoffo wines klockwerks d73 leathers aerial vuz formosa group egrafx simi valley cycles and idplatforms with many more in the works

a lot motorcyclists are forced into a sort of riding hibernation for several months of the year a terrible period of time when it is just too damned cold to ride or too dangerous
most people call this period of time winter but i like to refer to it as hell on earth
sure i enjoy some winter activities like seeing how many layers of clothing i can wear all at once or mistyping text messages on my phone because i cannot feel my fingers but having to lock my bike in a cage you might call it a garage for six months out of the year is just plain rud
i love ridingit is mostly all i spend my time thinking aboutand it is something i want to do just about every day of the year excluding days that i am stuck inside with the flu or sick from one too many whiskies the night before
while i grew up in an area of the united states that does indeed possess all four seasonscold colder cold as hell and hey i am not seasonally depressed for a few weeks out of the yeari wised up at a young age realizing i needed to exchange my thermal underwear for board shorts and flip flops and i fled my home state of maine for the sunny shoreline of southern california as soon as i graduated from university
i now live in san diego close to where the nuviz hq is located and i am spoiled to say the leasti can ride every day of the year that i want to aside from when it is raining because californian drivers turn into the wicked witch of the west when a few drops of precipitation come down i am melting melting get it
sorry my jokes suck
anyways while a lucky few of us nuviz employees get to reside in this beautiful city with perfect weather throughout most of the year the majority of our staff lives in finland close to our rd offices in the finnish city of salo
if you have never been to finland well it is cold
i have only been there once for around five or six days and for most of those five or six days i could not feel my face
while i was there however i was fortunate enough to meet our mechanicalreliability test engineer marko
marko is awesome but marko is also a nut
when i pulled into the parking lot of the salo offices for the first time there was a motorcycle parked next to the entrance
that is markos bike another coworker told me
wait wh
what is it doing there nestled in between snowbanks and resting on the thick layer of ice that covered the parking lots surface
as it turned out that bike is markos daily commuter even when temperatures are well below freezing and the fear of slipping on the ice while walking is high let alone while piloting a motorcycle
markos old honda nx650 dominator is probably better suited for winter riding more than other bikes since it is light in weight and easier to handle than a heavy bigtwin or powerful sport bike but still winter road conditions can be sketchy enough in a car
to battle the cold marko had installed heated hand muffs to keep his fingers from icing over and a power output to connect his heated visor system
other than that roadlegal studs in his tires we are the only other thing he had done to equip his twowheeled steed for finlands harsh winters
it is not hard but you have to take the conditions into account marko explained
you should also be well familiar with what to do when your tires are slipping because they are all the time
we also have a couple of external trusted user testers that ride during the winter so i am not the only on
some riders in finland are riding in areas where there are not a lot of people and houses nearby and then you have to take more serious precautions and prepare to keep yourself warm in the case of engine failure or something els
that led to my next question for markohow the hell does he keep warm
not letting the cold air blow inside your gear is a must he told me
if you fail to do so you will notice it pretty soon though 
you also have to wear enough warm layers underneath i watched marko gear up one afternoon after work was over and about two hours later he was ready for the ride home
back to the dedication part how does this help us at nuviz
well just because it is winter out the show still needs to go on right
our rd engineers and tut riders are constantly testing out new features for upcoming software updates and marko uses his ride to work to do this on a daily basis
normally i just quickly test some new features that are difficult or impossible to test with a car like speed sensitive volume preset curves and daily commuting to work and back can be perfect for that
in this weather and with my existing gear i think an hour max is all i can handle without a break for hot coffee
plus winter in finland is pretty long to wait for the next riding season and now i do not get so anxious waiting to get on my bike
it is a slightly different feeling getting to ride to work during a wintery sunrise instead of driving in a car especially when you take a shortcut via the sea on ice             share     tweet     pin it     fancy     add             nuvizs niki tuuli joins sic racing team in moto2 championship  may 14 2018      tuuli improves takes seventh at assen  may 02 2018               subscribe to our newsletter  stay updated

in assen tuuli kept his 2018 trend alive as he improved yet again earning seventh place on the weekend in the wake of his first appearance in superpole 2 the qualifying session where the top12 fastest racers from timed practice fight for pole position on sundays starting grid where he set the eighth fastest lap time landing him a thirdrow spot for the start of the race
in sundays race tuulis jump off the grid from p8 was not his best but after losing a couple positions he kept his sights on the lead pack and rode on to capture his best finish since last november in qatar
despite the improvement tuuli still is not pleased with his performance and the young racer knows he can do better
todays result was good but my riding was not tuuli explained following the race
i lost a couple of positions right in the start and then could not keep myself in the first group
i have to concentrate on my riding and keep the frustration away
anyhow a positive weekend and a step forward
many thanks to my hard working team and all others  dutch round world supersport race results   2018 fim supersport world championship standings  1

the 22yearold from imatra finland currently sits eighth in this years fim supersport world championship after five races and will make the jump to the premier series of professional motorcycle racing for the first time to fulfill a lifelong dream of joining the grand prix paddock
first of all i want say thanks to the sic racing team for this opportunity tuuli stated following the break of the news
i am really excited and looking forward to this upcoming challenge
moto2 has been one of my dreams and now it is a reality while being faced with the challenges of adapting to a new bike a 600cc kalex machine as well as new tracks tuuli has been racing 600cc motorcycles for quite some time now and should quickly feel right at home on the unfamiliar equipment
i have been riding 600cc bikes since 2012 he explained
the first six years we are with yamaha and now this season i have been riding with honda
obviously moto2 is different than supersport but the sic racing team is a good team with lots of experience so with their help i believe i can adapt well to the moto2 class
i want to get the best results i can and perform as well as possible but at the same time i need to be patient and focus on adapting to the moto2 class every lap and every session            share     tweet     pin it     fancy     add             schuberth custom helmet mount now available  may 30 2018      winter rd  may 04 2018               subscribe to our newsletter  stay updated

the flipup chin bar style of modular helmets prevents our regular headset from being used due to the location of the wires but now modular users can hardwire their helmets up thanks to the headsets cable design which is long enough to be installed on the outside surface of the helmet allowing it to reach the pivot point of the helmets chin bar so it can flip up unrestricted
the headset can be purchased for 3499 usd on ridenuvizcom  and for any additional information please reach out to our support team at supportridenuvizcom

to deliver exciting new products that provide a better riding experience for our customers
that however does not mean we will not continuously strive to improve the products that our customers have already purchased
no matter how good a product is it can always be better which is why we are excited to release nuv15 for download through the nuviz app

key features of the nuv15 software release include  sirigoogle now support   initiate sirigoogle now voice assistant using the nuviz controller voice key long press allowing for a truly handsoff experience

while our work is important to us we are riders too and any day we can spend listening to the revs of an enginebe it from an inline fourcylinder or a rumbling vtwinor actually throwing on a helmet ourselves and going for a cruise sign us up
following the recent launch of our first generation of nuviz headup display devices we wanted to be where the action is and where our customers are
so to kickoff the first of many events we will attend in the near future we decided to make the drive from our offices in san diego up to auto club speedway in fontana california for what is arguably one of the most intense yet relaxed days you can spend on two wheels
fastrack riders is the premier track experience in southern california one which we are proud to sponsor alongside several other great companies within our industry
everyone from your average sportbike owner who is looking to put their machine and skills to the test legally and safely to racing legends like the bostrom brotherseric and bencome out for a oneofakind weekend on the tarmac
auto club speedway is a twomile 3 km lowbanked dshaped oval superspeedway that has hosted nascar racing annually since 1997 but the facility also utilizes the infield of the massive oval to accommodate several other types of motorsports including a roadcourse layout for motorcycles and autos
fastrack riders offers motorcycle training schools and track days available to the public on this road course and while several racers and trackgoers opt out of riding on public roads racing is something we are passionate about and going fast on two wheels is damned cool no matter how you slice it
you cannot truly experience a nuviz device without it properly set up on a helmet let alone test one out so to help riders demo a nuviz in style and comfort 6d helmets delivered a full size run of their topoftheline ats1 helmet to ensure the right fit for anyone actually taking to the streets
the ats1 features 6ds patented omnidirectional suspension ods technology an inhelmet suspension and kinetic energy management system that allows the helmet to sheer and displace threedimensionally when subjected to impact
in other words it is good for your noggin in case of a crash
we also enjoy the helmets integrated speaker pockets that provide a perfect fit for the nuviz headsets
our goal for the next year
get out and meet as many motorcycle enthusiasts as we can
from track days to bike nights to rallies to races we want to hit as many amazing events as possible to offer technical support for existing nuvizers and to provide demos for those who have yet to get their hands on a deviceas well as to have a little fun in the process

b8ta founded by software engineer vibhu norby alongside william mintun and phillip raub developed their oneofakind business model aiming to provide better options to companies launching new products while wanting to maintain control over their brands
the transactional nature of a company selling a product to a retailer and a retailer marking it upwithout the manufacturer having any visibility or control of the marketing of their products at retaildoes not make sense in todays world says raub b8tas cmo  b8tas brickandmortar locations provide the perfect opportunity for consumers to get their hands on new tech gadgets and actually try them out before buying
and the kicker
b8ta does not make money on the products it sells
the brands they feature keep 100 percent of the money on every sale and b8ta simply charges for instore space and services
products are shipped to b8ta and manufacturer representatives train the b8ta teama highly knowledgeable staff that can describe the attributes of the product
for brands it is a learning curve and an opportunity to understand if their products are priced properly and if the content on their displays is resonating with customers raub explains
we feel invested in making them successful by coming in and learning what is working and what is not raub explains
as of today nuviz is available in b8tas santa monica and austin locations and the san francisco and houston stores will be included in the coming week

yes we are based in san diego where bikes and beaches go together like stripper poles and stilettos but more often than not all the cool events are held where there is plenty of room to run and play and urban beach areas in southern california are typically without
roland sands design thought otherwise however and after dreaming about a beachfront moto event for years the rsd crew kicked off the inaugural moto beach classic this past october at bolsa chica state beach an underdeveloped beach area just north of huntington city beach in orange county california
partnering with sea legs live an outdoor concert venue on the sand at bolsa chica rsds oneday festival brought bikes babes bands and booze together at the beachall the bs any moto lover can only wish for in one placealong with many of the best brands within the motorcycle community
amazing vendors super hooligan flat track racing drag and minibike racing motorcycle stunt shows surf comps local artists food and custom motorcycles packed bolsa chica to capacity with the help of twowheel enthusiasts from all over and to top it off reggae tunes filled the air during the day with live performances by black uhuru and wargirl while punk rock closed out the night with lit and unwritten law taking the stage
is the moto beach classic an event we will look forward to in the future

we are already counting down the days until next years and we hope to see as many of you there as possibl

what most do not realize however is how small our motorcycle industry actually is and no matter what city or country we are in or what event we are working at we always see some of the same friendly faces
the shift boutique area at this years progressive international motorcycle shows is the latest creation from the folks at ims and aside from a rad little lounge area in the middle of the show floor that features multiple boutiquestyle brands for visitors to check out shift actually helps bring the brands it hosts even closer together
the shared space allows us to mingle more check out each others products without wandering too far from our space and even laugh at whoever stumbles in a little late to the show with a hangover from the previous nights postshow festivities
we have had a blast so far at ims this year in long beach and new york and we are looking forward to the upcoming shows in dallas and chicago that we will attend in february
we hope to see you ther

jan 25 2018  posted by chris kimball    if you are reading this chances are you are in fact familiar with nuviz and you already know what a hud isto a certain extent
but what do you really know about headup displays
most information regarding hud technology can get a little too technical for your average consumer myself included but below you will find some basic info on what huds are where they came from and who uses them
but seriously though what in the actual hell is a hud
hud stands for headup display or headsup display but we use headup because most of us only have one head each which is any transparent display that presents data without requiring users to look away from their usual viewpoints
when we are huds developed
huds we are originally developed for military use specifically military aviation back in the 1940s and 1950s and actually evolved from a preworld war ii parallaxfree optical sight technology called the reflector sight
the reflector sight was invented in 1900 and is still the base component in many modern huds
where does the name come from
well this certainly is not rocket science
the origin of the name stems from a pilot being able to view information with the head positioned up and looking forward instead of angled down looking at lower instruments
another advantage that came from the use of huds was that the pilots eyes did not need to refocus to view outside of the cockpit after looking at the opticallynearer instruments
both of these factors are crucial to motorcyclists as well
some bikes have information displayed as far down as on the gas tank and we all know how dangerous it is to take your eyes off the road for even a split second
who uses huds today
today huds are used in commercial aircraft automobiles and other mostly professional applications but with the emergence of devices like the nuviz huds are becoming more available at the consumer level
what types of huds are there
other than fixed mounted huds where the displays are mounted to the cockpit of a plane or the dash of a vehicle there are also headmounted displays and helmetmounted displays both abbreviated hmd that feature a display element that moves with the orientation of the users head
many modern fighter jets such as the fa18 f16 and eurofighter use both a hud and hmd concurrent
the f35 lightning ii was designed without a hud relying solely on the hmd making it the first modern military fighter not to have a fixed hud
the price of one of these helmetmounted display systems
a cool 400000 usd
what does a typical hud consist of
a typical hud contains three primary components a projector unit a combiner and a videogeneration computer
the projection unit in a typical hud is an optical collimator setup a convex lens or concave mirror with a cathode ray tube lightemitting diode display or liquid crystal display lcd at its focus which produces an image where the light is collimated and the focal point is perceived to be at infinity
the combiner is typically an angled flat piece of glass a beam splitter located directly in front of the viewer that redirects the projected image from the projector so the user can see the field of view and the projected infinity image at the same tim
combiners may have special coatings that reflect the monochromatic light projected onto it from the projector unit while allowing all other wavelengths of light to pass through
in some optical layouts combiners may also have a curved surface to refocus the image from the projector
the computer provides the interface between the projection unit and the data to be displayed and generates the imagery and symbology to be displayed by the projection unit
what is an ar hud
the futur
modern headup displays are being replaced with a newer technology called augmented reality ar
these ar systems are the new version of huds but are far more advanced
ar huds can integrate with gps systems infrared cameras the internet and mobile apps and transform your car windshield helmet windscreen or even eyeglasses into an information screen
and yes nuviz is indeed an ar hud

busted out windows rooms connected by doorways carved by sledgehammers and concrete floors layered with dust provide an ambiance like no other but lining the brick walls of the old and decaying building are hundreds of custom classic concept and rare motorcycles that made the midwinter journey to stand trial before the show is judges
and while the bikes are the main attraction at the one moto show the fun goes far beyond glistening chrome and sparkling paint
vendors selling everything from helmets to hot dogs oneofakind motorcyclethemed art minibike races cold brews and some of portlands finest coffee keep your eyes and taste buds more than occupied and off location the weekend will keep you on your toes with after parties stunt shows and intense flat track racing at a local indoor speedway
nine years ago see see motor coffee co set out to celebrate the weird rare and unconventional bikes that they love in a way for everyone to enjoy and in doing so they have created something that should be on every motorcycle enthusiasts bucket list
the one moto show is hopefully here to stay for years to come and we cannot wait to return next year to see what they have in store for its 10year anniversary
hopefully we will see you there too

and although it is held in the dead of winter the cold did not stop what was almost 60000 finnish motorcycle enthusiasts from flocking to the messukeskus expo and convention centre helsinki to check out the latest and greatest in gear and machines from the largest brands around the world
is it easy to get excited about a motorcycle show when you still have months away from throwing a leg over your favorite machine
according to the finns being cooped up inside is the perfect time to start preparing for the upcoming seasons journeys whether it is simply buying a few new parts or completely tearing down your bike and building something crazy
not to mention the mp show has europes largest indoor test track which allows people attending the event to try out some new bikes as well as get their riding fix without crashing into a snowbank

while there are numerous highquality helmet manufacturers on the market that all have complete ranges of fullface options designed primarily to meet todays high standards of comfort and protection style is also a crucial factor when riders choose the helmet that is right for them
helmet brands want to stand out from the rest with their design and for that reason the contours of helmet chin bars vary drastically
so what does that mean
some helmets are unfortunately more difficult than others to mount a nuviz
for a secure fit we recommend to our customers that at least 23 of the helmet mount is adhered firmly to the surface of their chin bar but if that is not possible due to the shape we have another trick up our sleevea magical substance called sugru
what the hell is sugru you ask
sugru mouldable glue is a soft and malleable material similar to playdough but after you roll it in your fingers press it where you need it and mold it by hand into any shape it hardens into a waterproof and longlasting product similar to other silicone rubbers
you can use it to fix just about anything but we use it almost as an extension to our mounting plate that allows us to fix our nuviz firmly to any chin bar on the market
once you open the package sugru reacts at room temperature simply by the exposure to air and you have about 30 minutes to shape it smooth it and reposition it as required
let sit for 24 hours and voila tricky chinbar problem solved
we typically use an entire black 3pack for one helmet mount which costs roughly 12 us
eventually we would love to have custom mounting plates for every helmet on the market which we have actually started working on with schuberth but until then this is the best option out there
if you have any questions about using the product feel free to contact us at supportridenuvizcom 
the link for the black 3pack is below
happy riding

the answer is yes
nuviz can be paired with any bluetooth headset that shares the same bluetooth specifications and profiles a2dp media profile and hfp phone profile which means you can leave the wired headset in the box
the following doityourself video will take you through the quick and easy steps required to pair your nuviz and bluetooth headset

all proceeds go to the pediatric brain tumor foundation 
last year was a revelation said bryan carroll producer of why we ride films organizers of the ev
the number of people who participated and the diversity was really inspirational
riders came from multiple states and countries as far away as mexico and india  people of all stripes with a common love of motorcycle riding came together and took part and that same wide array of participants are signing up this year as well
onethird of entrants for this years ride are new building on wordofmouth raving by past and returning riders and growing a community of likeminded people that feels like a large extended family
of course everyone loves a good because but the diversity of sponsors and participants really illustrates how the hollywood motorcycling and other communities have united to benefit those in need namely children with serious medical issues
the ride has consistently doubled its raise every year and this type of growth in funds raised is expected again this year
participants in the charity ride enjoy a bevy of perks in addition to the awesome ride including cocktails and vittles at the wwr riders dinner gift bags special guest speakers and vip access to the quail motorcycle gathering including a private ride to the event exclusive parking and private lounge access
participants really engaged last year said bryan carroll
we had a lot of people with a lot of different backgrounds and everyone really came together had fun and bonded
we are looking to build on that this year then really ramp things up for next years big fifthannual ride  of course none of this would be possible without great sponsorship
last years list of sponsors topped 25 and this years array for the fourth invitational why we ride to the quail is shaping up including refuse specialists  indian  motorcycles  motodoffo wines klockwerks d73 leathers aerial vuz formosa group egrafx simi valley cycles and idplatforms with many more in the works
there are a few openings left for sponsorship and anyone interested can contact kenriseaboveconsultingcom

in assen tuuli kept his 2018 trend alive as he improved yet again earning seventh place on the weekend in the wake of his first appearance in superpole 2 the qualifying session where the top12 fastest racers from timed practice fight for pole position on sundays starting grid where he set the eighth fastest lap time landing him a thirdrow spot for the start of the race
in sundays race tuulis jump off the grid from p8 was not his best but after losing a couple positions he kept his sights on the lead pack and rode on to capture his best finish since last november in qatar
despite the improvement tuuli still is not pleased with his performance and the young racer knows he can do better
todays result was good but my riding was not tuuli explained following the race
i lost a couple of positions right in the start and then could not keep myself in the first group
i have to concentrate on my riding and keep the frustration away
anyhow a positive weekend and a step forward

a lot motorcyclists are forced into a sort of riding hibernation for several months of the year a terrible period of time when it is just too damned cold to ride or too dangerous
most people call this period of time winter but i like to refer to it as hell on earth
sure i enjoy some winter activities like seeing how many layers of clothing i can wear all at once or mistyping text messages on my phone because i cannot feel my fingers but having to lock my bike in a cage you might call it a garage for six months out of the year is just plain rud
i love ridingit is mostly all i spend my time thinking aboutand it is something i want to do just about every day of the year excluding days that i am stuck inside with the flu or sick from one too many whiskies the night before
while i grew up in an area of the united states that does indeed possess all four seasonscold colder cold as hell and hey i am not seasonally depressed for a few weeks out of the yeari wised up at a young age realizing i needed to exchange my thermal underwear for board shorts and flip flops and i fled my home state of maine for the sunny shoreline of southern california as soon as i graduated from university
i now live in san diego close to where the nuviz hq is located and i am spoiled to say the leasti can ride every day of the year that i want to aside from when it is raining because californian drivers turn into the wicked witch of the west when a few drops of precipitation come down i am melting melting get it
sorry my jokes suck
anyways while a lucky few of us nuviz employees get to reside in this beautiful city with perfect weather throughout most of the year the majority of our staff lives in finland close to our rd offices in the finnish city of salo
if you have never been to finland well it is cold
i have only been there once for around five or six days and for most of those five or six days i could not feel my face
while i was there however i was fortunate enough to meet our mechanicalreliability test engineer marko
marko is awesome but marko is also a nut
when i pulled into the parking lot of the salo offices for the first time there was a motorcycle parked next to the entrance
that is markos bike another coworker told me
wait wh
what is it doing there nestled in between snowbanks and resting on the thick layer of ice that covered the parking lots surface
as it turned out that bike is markos daily commuter even when temperatures are well below freezing and the fear of slipping on the ice while walking is high let alone while piloting a motorcycle
markos old honda nx650 dominator is probably better suited for winter riding more than other bikes since it is light in weight and easier to handle than a heavy bigtwin or powerful sport bike but still winter road conditions can be sketchy enough in a car
to battle the cold marko had installed heated hand muffs to keep his fingers from icing over and a power output to connect his heated visor system
other than that roadlegal studs in his tires we are the only other thing he had done to equip his twowheeled steed for finlands harsh winters
it is not hard but you have to take the conditions into account marko explained
you should also be well familiar with what to do when your tires are slipping because they are all the time
we also have a couple of external trusted user testers that ride during the winter so i am not the only on
some riders in finland are riding in areas where there are not a lot of people and houses nearby and then you have to take more serious precautions and prepare to keep yourself warm in the case of engine failure or something els
that led to my next question for markohow the hell does he keep warm
not letting the cold air blow inside your gear is a must he told me
if you fail to do so you will notice it pretty soon though 
you also have to wear enough warm layers underneath i watched marko gear up one afternoon after work was over and about two hours later he was ready for the ride home
back to the dedication part how does this help us at nuviz
well just because it is winter out the show still needs to go on right
our rd engineers and tut riders are constantly testing out new features for upcoming software updates and marko uses his ride to work to do this on a daily basis
normally i just quickly test some new features that are difficult or impossible to test with a car like speed sensitive volume preset curves and daily commuting to work and back can be perfect for that
in this weather and with my existing gear i think an hour max is all i can handle without a break for hot coffee
plus winter in finland is pretty long to wait for the next riding season and now i do not get so anxious waiting to get on my bike
it is a slightly different feeling getting to ride to work during a wintery sunrise instead of driving in a car especially when you take a shortcut via the sea on ice             share     tweet     pin it     fancy     add             nuvizs niki tuuli joins sic racing team in moto2 championship  may 14 2018      tuuli improves takes seventh at assen  may 02 2018               subscribe to our newsletter  stay updated

the 22yearold from imatra finland currently sits eighth in this years fim supersport world championship after five races and will make the jump to the premier series of professional motorcycle racing for the first time to fulfill a lifelong dream of joining the grand prix paddock
first of all i want say thanks to the sic racing team for this opportunity tuuli stated following the break of the news
i am really excited and looking forward to this upcoming challenge
moto2 has been one of my dreams and now it is a reality while being faced with the challenges of adapting to a new bike a 600cc kalex machine as well as new tracks tuuli has been racing 600cc motorcycles for quite some time now and should quickly feel right at home on the unfamiliar equipment
i have been riding 600cc bikes since 2012 he explained
the first six years we are with yamaha and now this season i have been riding with honda
obviously moto2 is different than supersport but the sic racing team is a good team with lots of experience so with their help i believe i can adapt well to the moto2 class
i want to get the best results i can and perform as well as possible but at the same time i need to be patient and focus on adapting to the moto2 class every lap and every session            share     tweet     pin it     fancy     add             schuberth custom helmet mount now available  may 30 2018      winter rd  may 04 2018               subscribe to our newsletter  stay updated

the flipup chin bar style of modular helmets prevents our regular headset from being used due to the location of the wires but now modular users can hardwire their helmets up thanks to the headsets cable design which is long enough to be installed on the outside surface of the helmet allowing it to reach the pivot point of the helmets chin bar so it can flip up unrestricted
the headset can be purchased for 3499 usd on ridenuvizcom  and for any additional information please reach out to our support team at supportridenuvizcom
